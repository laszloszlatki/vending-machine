# Vending Machine app in javafx

## Objectives:

1.	Incorporate the persistent files client.dat, admin.dat and product.dat into the system  
2.	Add a graphical user interface (GUI) to the system using JavaFX  
3.	Add operator authentication services. This requires changes to the user interface to distinguish between an admin operator (who can restock the machine, do the end-of-day procedure and logout) and a ‘normal’ client who can interact with the machine to view all products, buy a product and logout. Such an authentication service would allow a user to provide their username and their authentication code/password. This would be verified against the code stored in the client.dat/admin.dat text file
